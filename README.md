## The Odin Project

# Project: To-do list

**Live version** of the site can be found [here](https://renchester.github.io/top-todo-list/)

This to-do list webapp allows you to take notes, list tasks, and organize these tasks through projects.

Features:

1. _*Home Page*_
   This main panel displays all the tasks listed regardless of their project. Within the task bar are options to display the task details, edit the details, and delete the task entirely.

2. _*Sidebar*_
   The sidebar allows you to filter the tasks either by project, by urgency, or by their due dates. The details of the project are also editable

3. _*Notes*_
   The notes tab displays all the notes taken.

Add tasks by clicking on the "Add" button (located at the bottom of the main panel). Enter in a description, due date, urgency, and project name. Tasks listed without specific projects will only show up in the default _Home_ panel.
